# General Action Plan

The action plan of the whole AAMIA Softwares research branch.

## Step 1

Finish the whole centerline estimation pipeline.

Explore new techniques - Graphs, Attention

Publish paper on it.

Required: Centerlines annotation data (NAS-> FFR/Papers/CAT08 has the most precise annotation pipeline)
Available: CAT08-training
           (Monzino)

## Step 2

Finish filaments endpoints classifier for centerline tracker.

Publish paper on the ML method to discrimidate filament endpoints from other types of points (the work you already started).

## Step 3

Plaques radiomics.

Learn to identify vulnerable plaques with combination above.

Write paper abut it.

Required: Plaque segmentation and CT data.
Available: Monzino

## Step 4

Build Sophisticated plaque segmentation, classification.

## Step 5

Identify vessels geometry (lumen, outer wall, intersections)
All to be used and visualised in 3D.

## Step 6

Start putting everytg√¨hing together.
options: Standalone GUI
         Slicer module (has the advantage of being an already working environment and has good data structures and docs)

## Step 7

Introduce FFR and other functional studies.

## Step 8

Perfusion.

## Step 9

Heart segmentation and 3D reconstruction of anatomy.

## Step 10

Patient-tailored perfusion (Fusion of coronary anatomy - heart segmentation - heart analysis - perfusion).

## Always

Gather CT (without contrast liquid) and CCTA (with contrast liquid) data.

Gather labelled data:
    Centrelines
    Plaques location and length
    Plaques material analysis

Publish paper ad each step.
